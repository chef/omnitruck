# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

## What is an ADR?

An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs are a way to document how and why a decision was reached within a project.

## Why use ADRs?

- **Historical record**: ADRs provide a historical record of decisions, helping new team members understand past choices
- **Knowledge sharing**: They capture the context, options, and reasoning that isn't visible in code alone
- **Avoiding repeated discussions**: They document decisions that have already been made
- **Making the decision process explicit**: They clarify the decision-making process by documenting alternatives considered

## When to write an ADR

Write an ADR when you make a significant decision that impacts:
- System architecture
- API design and changes
- Platform support decisions
- Dependency choices
- Security implementations
- Performance optimizations

## ADR Format

Each ADR should follow this structure:

1. **Title**: A short, descriptive title (e.g., "ADR 0002: Migration to Redis Cluster")
2. **Date**: When the decision was made
3. **Context**: Background information explaining the need for a decision
4. **Decision**: The chosen solution with reasoning
5. **Implementation**: Code examples or diagrams explaining how the decision is implemented
6. **Alternatives Considered**: What other options were evaluated and why they weren't selected
7. **Benefits**: The advantages of the chosen approach
8. **Future Considerations**: Potential impacts or future work

## How to Create a New ADR

1. Copy the template below
2. Create a new file named `adrXXXX.md` where XXXX is the next sequential number
3. Fill in the sections
4. Submit a PR for review

## Template

```markdown

### Decision

[What is the change being proposed? How will it solve the problem?]

### Implementation

```[code language]
[Add code examples or diagrams]
```

### Sequence Diagram (if applicable)

```mermaid
[Add a sequence diagram]
```

### Benefits

[List benefits of this approach]

### Alternative Solutions Considered

[Describe alternatives and why they weren't chosen]

### Future Considerations
